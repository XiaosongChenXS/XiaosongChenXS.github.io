I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Macau, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huanle Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/people/huanlexu/) at the [Cloud and Distributed Systems Lab](https://cds-macau.github.io). While some create on a canvas, I create through the elegance of mathematics and the power of code.
